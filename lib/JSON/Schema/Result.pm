=head1 NAME

JSON::Schema::Result - the result of checking an instance against a schema

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $validator = JSON::Schema->new($schema);
 my $json      = from_json( ... );
 my $result    = $validator->validate($json);
 
 if ($result)
 {
   print "Valid!\n";
 }
 else
 {
   print "Errors\n";
	print " - $_\n" foreach $result->errors;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<JSON::Schema::Result> is returned by the L<JSON::Schema> C<validate>
method. It uses L<overload> to mimic a boolean. That is:

  if ($result) { foo(); } else { bar(); }

Will do "foo" if the result is positive for validity and "bar" if it's negative.

There's also a method C<errors> to get a list of errors. (Which will be
empty in the case of a positive result.) Each error is a L<JSON::Schema::Error>.
